        Monday to Friday, before 6pm, I am a Ph.D. in Mathematics operating as
        research scientist in the field of Numerical Analysis
        and High Performance Scientific Computing.

        The rest of the time I enjoy riding my bike, eating, and cooking. I am
        very passionate about mountains and outdoor activities such as camping
        and barbecueing in the wild.

      <h2 id="current-position">Current position</h2>
        <p>
        I currently work in Nice, France, as research scientist for <a href="http://neurodec.ai/">Neurodec</a>.

        My colleagues and I are developing our Myoelectric Digital Twin, i.e., a
        virtual clone of your arm where the quasi-static Maxwell equations
        ruling the physics inside of it are precisely reproduced.
        <br>
        <i>Why that?</i> You may ask. Well, the force exerted by a muscle
        depends on the number of motor units (neurons commanding bunches of
        muscle fibers) activation and the rates at which they discharge action
        potentials.
        </p>

        <figure>
        <img src="imgs/neurodec/fiber_properties.gif" width=100% height: auto>
        <figcaption>
        <small><small><center><p>
        The action potentials are "wrinkles" in the base-line electric potential
        that propagates from neuromuscular junctions along muscle fibers until
        they hit the tendons.
        </p></center></small></small>
        </figcaption>
        </figure>


        <p>
        This process produces an electromagnetic 'footprint' (EMG signals) that
        can be recorded by skin electrodes and use to train a computer to
        associate movements and gestures to such 'footprints'.
        </p>

        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
        However, the acquisition of real EMG data is time-consuming and expensive. It
        requires expert knowledge and is error-prone even in the best circumstances.
        Moreover, the produced dataset has limited variability, is highly
        specific and it is only partially labeled, at best.
        </p>

        Here at Neurodec, we develope the
        <a href="http://neurodec.ai/mdt/documentation/index.html">MDT</a>
        software, capable of simulating arbitrary large datasets of ultra-realistic
        synthetic EMG signals.
        The simulation is very fast, the data is extremely precise and perfectly
        labeled, making it ideal for training industrial AI-based algorithms.

      <h2 id="research-interests">Research interests</h2>
        <p>
        At the moment, my scientific focus lies on
        <ul>
          <li>
            Low-Tech Highly-Efficient <b>CPU/GPU implementations of Finite Elements</b>
            (FE) solvers: tired of the unnerving intricacy of the state-of-the-arts
            FE implementations, I created my own FE environment.
            What I expected being no more than a handy inquiry tool, turned out
            to be quite a <i>slick and highly-efficient gadget</i>.

            Now, I aim to assemble, <i>in less than a thousand</i> MATLAB/Python
            lines, the richest FE software possible, and to make it faster than
            the best-established <i>compiled</i> FE machineries.

            </figure>
            Will I be successful? Can't say yet. As now, I only got one of the
            fastest generator ever of colorful pictures.

            <b>Design of integrator-solutor pairs in Exponential Integration of
            stiff PDEs</b>, recently with special attention to the so-called
            <i>Shallow Water Equations</i> (SWEs).
            </p>
            <figure>
            <img src="imgs/research_interests/swe-compressed.png" width=100% height: auto>
            <figcaption><small><small><p>
            Atmospheric simulations (in picture a flattened Earth) are among the
            most prominent SWEs applications as the planar length scales are
            much greater than the vertical one (atmosphere wraps Earth as
            plastic wrap on a basketball).

            In particular, we endeavour to design numerical schemes that ignore
            some of the stiffest components in our SWE system.
            Those fast moving components are, in fact, sound waves, whose
            (costly) propagation does not really affect the simulation outcome
            (which is a fancy way to say that you won't make it rain by
            screaming at clouds).

            Efficiently <b>computing</b> linear combinations of the so called
            <b>matrix phi-functions</b> arising in the context of <b>Exponential
            Integration of stiff PDEs</b>.

            For a given matrix <b>A</b>, such linear combinations can be formed
            by computing the action of a slightly larger, upper block diagonal
            matrix <b>&Atilde;</b>, as in figure, with <b>W</b> and <b>J</b>
            depending on the desired combination.

            <figure>
            <img src="imgs/research_interests/AtildeAWJ.png" width=50% height: auto>
            <figcaption><small><small><p>
            To give an idea, usually <b>A</b> has millions of rows/columns while <b>J</b> is, like,
            a 4 by 4 matrix at most. The matrix <b>W</b> is full and <b>J</b> is
            the null matrix with ones on the first upper diagonal.
            </p></small></small></figcaption>
            </figure>
            </center>
            In a typical exponential integrator, we are tasked to compute hundred
            if not thousands of times the action of the exponential of <b>&Atilde;</b>
            with varying matrices <b>W</b> and <b>J</b>.
            This is a vastly repetitive task. We exploited this characteristic
            of exponential integrators to develop
            <a href="https://github.com/francozivcovich/bamphi">bamphi</a>,
            a routine computing the action of the matrix exponential which is
            designed to collect and reuse the information about <b>A</b> gathered
            through the exponential integration steps, reaching unmatched levels
            of speed and accuracy on a variety of numerical experiments
            (see <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377042722005714">CCZ22</a>).
          </li>

          <li>
            <p>
            once again, <b>Exponential Integration of stiff PDEs</b>: this time
            for computing linear combinations of phi-functions of matrices that
            are in <b>Kronecker form</b>.
            Matrices in this form are very common, as they arise from the Finite
            Differences (FD) discretization of differential operators.
            For such matrices, there exists a way of computing the action
            their exponential (based on the BLAS3 matmul routine) which is
            <i>madly efficient</i>, both over CPU and GPU parallel architectures.
            In particular, we shown in
            <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=it&user=oHN16zwAAAAJ&citation_for_view=oHN16zwAAAAJ:UeHWp8X0CEIC">CCEOZ22</a>
            that the performance can be so extreme that are close to the
            theoretical limit of the hardware.

        However, my research interests include a host of topics from the wider

          <li>
            <p>
            <b>Arbitrary Precision</b> computing of <i>Functions of Matrices</i>.

            for computing the matrix exponential that is capable to grant any
            backward error accuracy disregarding the working precision.
            This is particularly relevant even in those cases where standard levels
            accuracy are needed.
