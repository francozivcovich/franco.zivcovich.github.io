    I started as Numerical Linear Algebraists
    Once I would have said that my research interests focused on the field of Numerical Linear Algebra but, as years went
    by, I found myself involved in fairly different branches of Numerical Analysis. I soon came to realise that my added
    value is the HPC mindset that I built through my adventurous path between Scientific Computing and Applied
    Mathematics.
